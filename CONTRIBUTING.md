# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

Start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SenseCraft-AI_Server/issues),
whether to identify a problem or outline a change. That issue should be used to
discuss the situation and agree on a plan of action before writing code or
sending a pull request. Maybe the problem isn't really a problem, or maybe there
are more things to consider. If so, it's best to realize that before spending
time and effort writing code that may not get used.

We appreciate your support and assistance. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow the guidelines below:
